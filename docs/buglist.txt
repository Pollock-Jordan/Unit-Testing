BUGS FOUND AND FIXED BY UNIT TEST (should be 4-5):

Bug 0:
  Class:  PrimitiveValue
	Method:  equals(Object v)
	Line: 18
	Cause:  both return value conditions needed to be met for equals()
                to be true but they were connected with an OR operator so only
                one condition needed to be met for true to be returned.
	Fix:    Changed || to &&

Bug 1:
  Class: Pair
	Method: compareTo(Pair p)
	Line:  30
	Cause:  This method was comparing the toString() value of the entire
                parameter pair to the key of this pair. Only the keys
                of each should have been compared
	Fix:    I created a new string to hold the string value of the key
                of the argument pair and a loop to extract it. Then
                I compared the two key strings of the pairs.

Bug 2:
  Class:  Pair
	Method:  toString()
	Line: 46
	Cause:  the name and value of the pair were printed beside
                eachother without the colon in between them as 
                expected with with a JSON pair
	Fix:    I changed the method to print [name + " : " + value]

Bug 3:
  Class: ArrayValue()
	Method: ArrayValue(JSONScanner js)
	Line: 19
	Cause: there is an if statement before the loop that reads
               in array values to check if the most recently read in
               value is null. The operater was == when it should have 
               been != to check if the value is not null
	Fix:   changed (v == null) to (v != null)

Bug 4:
  Class: Value
	Method: getValue(JSONScanner js)
	Line:  40
	Cause: there is no switch case for the JSONScanner to read in
               a closing square bracket.
	Fix:   I added a case statement that considers a closing
               square bracket and will return null if it is
               the case.

BUGS FOUND USING EXPECTED INPUT BUT NOT EASILY FIXED (2-3):

Bug 6:
  Class: ArrayValue
	Method: ArrayValue(JSONScanner js) //constuctor
	Line: 22
	Cause: not checking if values are properly separated by
               commas (invalid JSON input (t6.in) with ':' separating
               array values instead of ',') 
	Reason not Fixed: will throw UncheckedIOException, must be caught and
                          properly delt with.

Bug 7:
  Class: ObjectValue
	Method: ObjectValue(JSONScanner js) //constuctor
	Line: 23
	Cause: not checking if pairs are properly seperated by commas
               (invalid JSON input (t7.in) with ':' separtaing pairs instead
                of ',') 
	Reason not fixed: will throw UncheckedIOException, must be caught and
                          properly delt with.

Bug 8:
  Class: ObjectValue
	Method: ObjectValue(JSONScanner js) //constuctor
	Line: 22
	Cause: not cheching for a semi colon inbetween two values before making
               a pair out of them (invalid JSON input (t8.in) with ',' separtaing pair values 
               instead of ':')
	Reason not fixed: will throw UncheckedIOException, must be caught and
                          properly delt with.
